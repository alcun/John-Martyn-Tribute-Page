This is a John Martyn tribute page using HTML and CSS

It makes up the first part of my coding portfolio.

It demonstrates HTML and CSS features such as HTML tags, classes and IDs, Visual Design and flex-boxes.

If you have time you should check out some of John Martyn's songs, here are some of my favourites:

CURRENT VERSION:
Working tribute page with pictures, lyrics and link to biography


TO DO:

Reconfigure repository and 'git pages' so I can display individual projects (fix 404 error)

Perhaps add some more pictures/layout/interview/audio
