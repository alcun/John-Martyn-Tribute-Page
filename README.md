This is a John Martyn tribute page using HTML and CSS

It makes up the first part of my coding portfolio.

It demonstrates HTML and CSS features such as HTML tags, classes and IDs, Visual Design and flex-boxes.

If you have time you should check out some of John Martyn's songs, here are some of my favourites:
