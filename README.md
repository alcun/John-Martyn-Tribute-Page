#A Tribute Page

This is a John Martyn tribute page using HTML and CSS.

You can see this project live at the following URL:

https://alcun.github.io/John-Martyn-Tribute-Page/

It demonstrates HTML and CSS features such as HTML tags, classes and IDs, Visual Design and flex-boxes.

If you have time you should check out some of John Martyn's songs, here are some of my favourites:
