This is a John Martyn tribute page.

It makes up the first part of my coding portfolio.

It features the use of items such as HTML tags, classes and IDs, Visual Design, CSS  and CSS flex-boxes.

If you have time, you should check out some of John Martyn's songs.

You can see this project live at the following URL:

Enjoy!
